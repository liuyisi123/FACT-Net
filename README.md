The FACT-Net proposed in this study. (a) The two-stage model for ABP waveform reconstruction. Stage I is a parallel cross-hybrid architecture that provides constraint information for Stage II, which is a serial hybrid structure used for ABP waveform reconstruction; (b) Multi-scale CNN blocks in Stage I; (c) Mix-T blocks in Stage I.

The Cross-Platform Multi-Patient IoT Framework (CPMP-IoT) for Health Management proposed in this study. (a) An APP for individual monitoring that can perform offline reasoning. (b) The host computer integrated with FACT-Net can trigger the LAN function, and multiple IoT devices can simultaneously access and download health reports and data on the web page. (c) The system designed for multi-patient wards.
